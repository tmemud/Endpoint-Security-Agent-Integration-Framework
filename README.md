# Endpoint-Security-Agent-Integration-Framework
This project aims to create a flexible and extensible framework for integrating endpoint security agents into a centralized management platform.
The framework provides functionalities for deploying, managing, and monitoring endpoint security agents across distributed endpoints, ensuring comprehensive protection against malware, ransomware, and other threats.

Features:
Modular architecture supporting multiple endpoint security vendors and agent types (e.g., antivirus, anti-malware, EDR).
Centralized deployment of security agents to endpoints within the network.
Configuration management for fine-tuning security policies and settings.
Real-time monitoring and alerting for endpoint security events and incidents.
Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for centralized logging and analysis.
Automated threat response and remediation actions based on predefined policies.
Scalability and high availability to support large-scale deployments and enterprise environments.
Technologies Used:
Python (for backend logic)
Flask (for web application framework)
Docker (for containerization)
Integration with endpoint security vendors' APIs (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)
Integration with SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk, Elastic Stack)
How to run the project:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Docker if you haven't already.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run Docker Compose to build and start the containers: docker-compose up --build
Access the web application interface in your browser (typically http://localhost:5000).
Configure integrations with your chosen endpoint security vendors and SIEM systems.
